<p>Hello! I'm Prajeet Vijay, an undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
  I'm passionate about web development and am on a journey to master the skills needed to build engaging and functional websites.</p>

<p>My interest in technology and programming led me to enroll in a comprehensive web development bootcamp on Udemy, taught by Angela. 
  Through this course, I've gained hands-on experience with various web technologies and frameworks, and I'm continuously honing my skills to stay updated with the latest
   trends in the field.</p>

<p>As part of my learning journey, I've worked on several projects, including creating and styling web pages, and I document my experiences and insights on my YouTube channel, CodeClarity.
   On my channel, I provide recommendations, tutorials, and tips for fellow web development enthusiasts, starting with an overview of the best text editors for HTML</p>
